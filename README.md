# Emotions-Recognition
Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning
Overview
This project focuses on training a deep learning model to classify human facial expressions into seven different emotions: sad, happy, angry, disgust, neutral, fear, and surprise. The dataset consists of labeled images categorized by emotion, which are used to train and evaluate the model.

Dataset
The dataset is structured into training and testing folders, with each emotion having a separate subfolder containing corresponding images. The dataset is located at:

Training Data: /kaggle/input/emotions/Emotions/train
Testing Data: /kaggle/input/emotions/Emotions/test
Model Training
A deep learning model is trained on the dataset for 15 epochs with an image size of 64x64. The training process utilizes batch processing to optimize performance and improve model accuracy.

Visualization
To better understand the dataset, sample images from each emotion category are displayed using a visualization technique. This allows for a quick assessment of image quality and distribution across categories.

Evaluation
After training, the model is tested using unseen images from the test dataset. The model's performance is assessed based on its ability to correctly classify emotions.

Results
The trained model is applied to sample test images to verify its accuracy and effectiveness. The predictions are compared against the actual labels to evaluate overall performance.

Future Enhancements
Improve model performance by using data augmentation techniques.
Experiment with different neural network architectures for better accuracy.
Fine-tune hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate.
Integrate the model into a real-time emotion detection system.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability of deep learning models to classify human emotions based on facial expressions. The results highlight the effectiveness of training on a well-labeled dataset and provide insights into possible improvements for future work.
